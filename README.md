## FAQs

#### Can my discord account get banned from selfbot use?

YES!!! Please know the risk of using a selfbot before running this tool, as there is a possibility of a perm ban. (hasn't happened to us before so its a small risk.)

#### Whats the difference between a selfbot and regular bot?

Well a selfbot uses your Discord user token to access discords private APIs while a regular discord bot uses their public APIs that are heavily restricted and monitored.

#### Why is the selfbot not doing anything?

If you're running the selfbot and it isn't connecting properly, then most likely your temporarily blocked from accessing discords APIs and/or your IP blocked which will go away between 24-72 hours. You could always try the use of a VPN to mask your IP and see if that works for you.
